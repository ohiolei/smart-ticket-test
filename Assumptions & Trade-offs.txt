Assumptions & Trade-offs

No CSS frameworks → BEM naming conventions for maintainability.

Options API only (no Composition API, no TypeScript) for simplicity.

Minimal dependencies: only openai-php/laravel, chart.js.

AI classification runs asynchronously in a queued job.


What I’d Do With More Time

Role-based auth (admin vs agent vs user)

Email / Slack notifications when tickets classified

Bulk ticket CSV import/export

Better confidence calibration & AI retraining feedback
